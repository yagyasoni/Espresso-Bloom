# Chrome Extension: Flavorful Web Enhancements

This repository contains a Chrome extension that offers a variety of web enhancement "flavors." Each flavor provides specific functionalities, accessible either 
through the extension's interface or by directly downloading and utilizing the corresponding flavor's files.

## Installation (Chrome Extension)

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:** Download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it, or clone it using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2.  **Enable Developer Mode in Chrome:**
    * Open Google Chrome.
    * Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
    * Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top right corner.

3.  **Load the Unpacked Extension:**
    * Click the "Load unpacked" button.
    * Select the directory containing the cloned or extracted repository.

4.  **Using the Extension:**
    * Once installed, the extension icon will appear in the extensions list.
    * To make it visible in the Chrome toolbar, click the Extensions button (puzzle icon) in the top-right corner and click the Pin icon next to the extension.
    * Click the extension icon in the toolbar.
    * Select the desired flavor.
    * The extension will download the folder for that flavor, containing the flavor's JSON file.
    * After downloading the flavor folder, click Load unpacked in the Chrome Extensions page.
    * Select the downloaded flavor folder to apply it.

5.  **Manual Download from GitHub (Faster Method):**
    * You can directly download the flavor folder from the GitHub repository, which contains the flavorâ€™s corresponding JSON file.
    * Once downloaded, click Load unpacked in the Chrome Extensions page.
    * Select the downloaded flavor folder to apply the enhancement.

This method bypasses the need to use the extension to download the flavor folder, speeding up the process.

## Why This Extension?

This extension provides customizable web enhancements, or "flavors," via downloadable configuration files (JSON). Due to the deprecation of Chrome's 
`chrome.theme` API (versions >132), direct theme application is not supported. Users select a flavor, download its configuration, and manually apply 
it through Chrome's "Load Unpacked" feature, offering flexibility and control.

## Available Flavors:

1.  **Flavor 1: Taro Latte**                                                                                     2.  **Flavor 2: Mocha Bliss**
